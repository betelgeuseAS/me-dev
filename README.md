# MeDev

My personal [website](https://betelgeuseas.github.io/me-dev/) with a list of my projects that help learn and blog posts web-development

![MeDev](src/assets/images/projects/me-dev.png)

## Development

The website is built on [React](https://react.dev/) and [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Running the project locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

To run the project locally in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
npm start
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

To run the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

To do ESLint and Type checking (in progress):

```bash
npm run lint
npm run type
```
